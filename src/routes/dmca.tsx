              Eduspark is a small, independently-run learning institute. Our mission with VidyaX is
              simple — help students who genuinely want to learn but cannot afford the price of
              premium coaching. Many bright kids in India lose their dream of a good career only
              because subscriptions, test series and reference books are out of their family budget.
              VidyaX exists to put that knowledge within their reach.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              We deeply respect every creator and institute that builds high-quality content. We are
              not trying to replace you, undercut your business, or profit from your effort — VidyaX
              is and always will be free, with no ads, no paid plans, and no resale. If anything
              referenced through VidyaX belongs to you and you would prefer it removed, we will take
              it down quickly and without argument. A polite email is enough — please write to{" "}
